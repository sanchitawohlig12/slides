    <h2>Why try Adobe Spark Page?</h2>
    <br />

    <p1 class="p1">
      Sometimes you don’t need a traditional website to get your message across.
      Adobe Spark Page is ideal for projects that don’t require more than one
      page, such as portfolios, resumes, presentations, blog posts, and photo
      galleries. Adobe Spark Page can showcase a product catalog, advertise a
      special offer, or act as a weekly or monthly newsletter for businesses.

      No matter what you create with Adobe Spark, you can do it without spending
      a penny. Adobe Spark Page and its companions, Adobe Spark Post and Adobe
      Spark Video, are available on the web and mobile from a single account.
      Additionally, Adobe hosts AdobeSpark Page, so you don’t need to sign up
      for web hosting to publish your pages.
